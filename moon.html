    <h1>Moon</h1>

    <!-- ChatGPT, Prompt: Write a short paragraph about the moon talking about its surface and other details -->
    <p class="info-text">
      The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, has a barren surface marked by craters, basins, and 
      plains formed by billions of years of meteorite impacts. Its crust is primarily composed of 
      silicate rock, with regions known as the lunar highlands being lighter in color and richer in 
      plagioclase minerals, while the darker maria are basaltic plains formed by ancient volcanic activity. 
      The Moon has no significant atmosphere, resulting in extreme temperature fluctuations between day and 
      night, ranging from about 127째C (261째F) to -173째C (-280째F). Its surface is covered with a fine, dusty 
      layer called regolith, composed of fragmented rock and particles created by constant micrometeorite impacts.
