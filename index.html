    <!-- ChatGPT, Prompt: Write a short paragraph describing the earth in some scientific detail -->
    <p class="info-text">
      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. 
      It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and is composed of a dense iron-nickel core, 
      a viscous mantle of silicate rock, and a thin, rigid crust. Earth's surface is approximately 71% water, 
      primarily in the form of vast oceans, with the remainder consisting of continents and islands. 
      The planet has a dynamic atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), which 
      plays a crucial role in regulating temperature and weather patterns. Earth's magnetic field, 
      protects the surface from harmful solar radiation, while the ozone layer in the stratosphere 
      shields life from ultraviolet rays.
